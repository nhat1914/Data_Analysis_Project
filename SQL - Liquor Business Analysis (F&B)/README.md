# Liquor Business Analytics Portfolio

## Overview
This project showcases my ability to design, query, and analyze real-world retail and wholesale datasets using Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL).
Itâ€™s built around operational data from a multi-store liquor group, featuring sales, inventory, supplier, and customer data modeled into a unified SQL schema for advanced analytics.

## The goal is to demonstrate:
- Strong data modeling and normalization skills.
- Advanced SQL query writing for business insight generation.
- ETL and data quality management within SQL Server.
- Real retail performance reporting and KPI automation.

## Data Sources:
- Sales Data: Transactional sales dataset with outlet, product, quantity, revenue, cost, profit, and timestamp.
- Price Data: Current product price listings per store and branch.
- PO Data: Purchase orders and receiving records by supplier and outlet.
- Transfer Data: Internal stock transfers between outlets.
- Customer Data: Customer profiles and IDs.
- Supplier Data: Supplier master list and IDs.

## Key SQL Features Demonstrated
- Data cleansing and transformation using TRY_CONVERT, ROUND, and CASE logic.
- Creation of views (v_sales_clean, v_sales_weekly) for reusable analytical layers.
- Advanced window functions for ranking, rolling averages, and trend detection.
- Aggregations by time, store, and category dimensions.
- Joins across multiple fact and dimension tables.
- Business logic queries for KPIs such as margin in %, churn, and inventory turnover.
- Real operational insight generation ready for Power BI or Excel dashboards.
