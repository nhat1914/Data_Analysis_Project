# Deep Learning for Sentiment Image Classification

I will develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based solution to classify images into six emotion categories: Happy, Sad, Fear, Pain, Anger, and Disgust. The dataset used in this project is collected from multiple online sources and is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yousefmohamed20/sentiment-images-classifier/data.)
